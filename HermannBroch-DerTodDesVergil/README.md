# Digital Humanities Materials to Hermann Broch's *Der Tod des Vergil*

This repository contains the following date related to Hermann Broch's text:
1. ***Erzählzeit*-to-*erzählte Zeit*** **Density.** Here, I compared how long Broch's inner monologue (i.e. stream-of-consciousness) novel would take to read in relation to the amount of time it depicts, providing a "number of words per hour depicted" ration. This number was compared to that of other inner monologue texts to demonstrate *Tod des Vergil*'s relative density.
2. **Associative Meanings.** I argue that apparent symbols in *Tod des Vergil* do not have fixed meanings, but rather signify according to non-semantic associations, most notably other words that appear in close proximity. Correspondingly, I measured out the meanings of specific terms by plotting out the terms that appear near them the most disproportionately.

In this repository, you can find additional materials used in my dissertation, including:

- A digitized copy of Hermann Broch's *Der Tod des Vergil* (1945) under the `raw-text` folder.
- Working textual manipulation scripts used in the quantitative analysis of Broch's text under the `scripts` folder.
- The resulting statistical breakdowns of the above text in the `statistics` folder.

Each folder provides further descriptions of their contents.
